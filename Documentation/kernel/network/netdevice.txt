struct net_device
=================

Identifiers
-----------
ifindex - is a second identifier for a network device, in addition to the name.
	  When a new network device is created, dev_get_index() assigns a new 
	  unused index to this device. This index allows you to quickly find a
	  network device from the list of all devices, which is much faster, 
	  compared to search by name.

iflink - specifies the index of the network device used to send a packet. This 
	 is normally the index ifindex, but, for tunneling network devices, 
	 such as ipip, iflink includes the index of the network device that is 
	 eventually used to send the enveloped packet.
	 Briefly, for virtual_device to find real_device.

Device State
------------
state - Queuing Discipline State which contains information about the network 
	device and network adapter, see enum netdev_state_t.

flags - interface flags(IFF_*).

reg_state - register/unregister state machine. Ee, its fine.

difference of them
------------------
NETDEV_UP			- Its notification chain with no comparability.
__LINK_STATE_START / IFF_UP	- ULNI said that the state and flag's domain 
				  are different although they have some overlap
				  variables. But yet cofuse me.
