struct net_device
-----------------
ifindex - is a second identifier for a network device, in addition to the name.
	  When a new network device is created, dev_get_index() assigns a new 
	  unused index to this device. This index allows you to quickly find a
	  network device from the list of all devices, which is much faster, 
	  compared to search by name.

iflink - specifies the index of the network device used to send a packet. This 
	 is normally the index ifindex, but, for tunneling network devices, 
	 such as ipip, iflink includes the index of the network device that is 
	 eventually used to send the enveloped packet.
