This is what I have known or may be forgotten tips in vim&ctags. So I record
it as an evidence that make you believe in me. I'm not a liar.

Generate tags (simplest way)
----------------------------
o ctags -R
 - This will generate a file named `tags' in current directory.

The Jump
--------
o vim -t `symbol name'
 - ex, $ vim -t main
