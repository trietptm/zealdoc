# Build tools in your work environment.
#
# every new tool that be added in this dir need do following things:
# 1. make a new directory with tools name.
# 	e.g: tool name is cscope, then mkdir cscope.
# 2. put the files you need in it.
# 3. make a build.sh which will do all installation things.
#
# Here we dont care howto install them, just configure the env.
# List of tools that I can think out:
# - im : input method
# - cscope : read code
#
