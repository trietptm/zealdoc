	help
	  Using an additional debugging library will this program become
	  considerable larger and will cause it to run more slowly.  You
	  should always leave this option disabled for production use.

	  dmalloc support:
	  ----------------
	  This enables compiling with dmalloc ( http://dmalloc.com/ )
	  which is an excellent public domain mem leak and malloc problem
	  detector.  To enable dmalloc, before running you will
	  want to properly set your environment, for example:
	    export DMALLOC_OPTIONS=debug=0x34f47d83,inter=100,log=logfile
	  The 'debug=' value is generated using the following command
	    dmalloc -p log-stats -p log-non-free -p log-bad-space -p log-elapsed-time \
	       -p check-fence -p check-heap -p check-lists -p check-blank \
	       -p check-funcs -p realloc-copy -p allow-free-null

	  Electric-fence support:
	  -----------------------
	  This enables compiling with Electric-fence support.  Electric
	  fence is another very useful malloc debugging library which uses
	  your computer's virtual memory hardware to detect illegal memory
	  accesses.  This support will make this program be considerable larger
	  and run slower, so you should leave this option disabled unless
	  you are hunting a hard to find memory problem.
