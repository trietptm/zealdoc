# Build tools in your work environment.
#
# ====================================
# ==== THEY WILL DO CONFIG THINGS ====
# ====================================
#
# every new tool that will be added in this dir need do following things:
# 1. make a new directory with the tool name.
# 	e.g: tool name is cscope, then `mkdir cscope'.
# 2. put the necessary files into the new directory.
# 3. make a build.sh which will do all installation things.
#
# Here we dont care howto install them, just configure them.
#
# List of tools that I can think up:
# - im 		: input method
# - cscope 	: read code
# - vim		: vim setting
# - home	: my home setting
